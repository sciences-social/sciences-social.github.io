    "text": "Policies\nAt the moment, the official rules are deliberately minimal, but they have important implications. First, if you don’t understand that “treat people with respect” means no sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia or casteism and precludes abusive behavior and doxxing, then you don’t belong on this site. Second, you must use your real name in your profile and we strongly encourage using your full name as your display name. While there are plenty of good reasons for anonymity on the internet, for our purposes being able to link online reputation to real-world reputation is important.\n\n\nPost Visibility\nPublic posts appear on the local timelines and federated timelines of sciences.social and all other mastodon instances that host your followers. Consider using Unlisted for posts you want your followers to see, but would prefer not to appear in public timelines. Using Unlisted for replies is strongly encouraged.\nPosts expressing racism, homophobia and the like are not allowed with or without a content warning or with any level of visibility.\n\n\nSensitive Media\nYou must mark media as sensitive if it contains violence or sexual content. We also request that you mark media as sensitive if it might trigger common phobias including arachnophobia (fear of spiders) and Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes).\n\n\nGetting along\nFolks come here from different academic, ethnic and national cultures, so there are likely to be some mismatches in tone when we talk to one another. People might be more blunt than you are used to, or you might think someone is frustratingly obtuse when they are just trying to be polite. It’s best to presume that folks here are acting in good faith. Mastodon has good tools for filtering or blocking posts you don’t want to see. However, if you think someone is deliberately violating the rules or negatively affecting the community as a whole, you can report them as described below.\n\n\nReporting bad behavior\nOne of the great strengths of Mastodon is the ability to restrict access to bad actors. sciences.social already blocks posts from dozens of sites known to host trolls and nazis, but there’ll be other bad behavior. If you use the “Report” action on someone’s post the moderators can review it and take action to restrict that account. Reporting helps even for people who make their home on other servers.\n\n\nContent Warnings\nContent warnings are an important part of both the technical infrastructure and the culture of the Mastodon online community. They aren’t just used for “triggering” content but also are often treated as a “headline” that allows people to choose whether they want to read the whole post. Click the CW link on your post to set one.\nWe strongly encourage the use of content warnings for posts that you think might be triggering or of limited interest, for example mentions of death or violence, and political debates centered on one country or locality.\nWhile expressions of racism, casteism, homophobia, and transphobia are off-limits, we do not require content warnings for posts about those topics and their effects on people, whether academic or otherwise. Use your own judgment about using content warnings on these topics."

    "text": "Threads, from Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, is the fastest growing social network ever with tens of millions of active users. It’s also about to support the ActivityPub protocol underlying the open Social Web - making it possible for folks on Mastodon servers like sciences.social to follow people on Threads and vice-versa.\nSome folks have argued that responsible online communities should preemptively block Threads since Meta has demonstrated lots of bad behavior.\nIt’s not an easy call, but the moderators and I decided a few months ago that we would take a wait and see approach to Threads. We’ll treat it like other large sites, blocking accounts that violate our rules and interact with our users. If we see too much bad behavior by Threads or its users we’ll block the whole site. This decision is similar to the one taken by datascience.social and mastodon.social.\nNote that you can block Threads for your personal account if you want. There are some instructions at the end of this post. And if you would like to migrate your Mastodon account to an instance that pre-emptively blocks Threads, that’s totally understandable too.\n\nThe argument against federating with Threads\nThere are several arguments against federating with threads.\n\nPeople worry about “Embrace, Extend and Extinguish”. If Threads becomes the dominant player in the fediverse, they will be able to dictate standards and then that make it difficult for others\nPeople don’t want their posts to be indexed and monetized by Threads, nor do they want their data to become part of Threads advertising and AI schemes.\nMeta has been a bad actor in the world. We shouldn’t doing anything that helps them succeed.\n\nThe most compelling argument against federating that I’ve seen comes from Erin Kissane. It’s worth a read.\n\n\nThe argument for federating\nThere are two main arguments for federating with Threads.\n\nIf we want the open Social Web to become a default communications mechanism and truly displace X and other proprietary platforms, we are going to need many millions of non-techy people to join. That likely means big coroporations are going to need to support them. Very few of us would sign up for a mail server that won’t send to gmail addresses, and arguably Threads is to the fediverse as Gmail is to email.\nThere’s a lot of people on Threads who we might want to interact with. If you’re like me you probably don’t care what the Kardashians are doing, but there are millions of other people on threads, and I know that there are some that are looking to connect with scientific content.\n\nPeople like Mastodon Founder Eugene Rochko and Fediverse evangelist Tim Chambers have been making the argument for treating Threads like any other new server.\n\n\nWhat you can do as an individual\nAs a member of a community that is going to federate with Threads, you still can control whether you see any posts from Threads and whether Threads receives posts directly from you. These steps are illustrated at the bottom of this post from infosec.exchange.\n\nSearch for threads.net in the web app\nClick on any account from there\nUse the … dropdown and choose “Block domain threads.net”\n\nOne thing that should be clear is that nothing you put out on the public internet is safe from being indexed and searched by Meta or anyone else. There are rules and conventions that the big search engines say they follow, but as long as it is technically possible for people to read your posts without a login, there’s no foolproof protection."
