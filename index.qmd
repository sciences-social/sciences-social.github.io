## Donate to support us

We are a non-profit organization run by unpaid volunteers - namely
[Mark Igra](https://sciences.social/@markigra), who founded the site,
[Pratik Mhatre](https://sciences.social/deck/@Pratik),
[Kristian Koerselman](https://sciences.social/deck/@economistatwork) and 
[Simon Lindgren](https://sciences.social/deck/@simonlindgren). Still
running the site costs money (about $150/month and rising) and we rely on donations to
foot the bill. We accept U.S. tax-deductible donations through
the [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.com/sciences-social).
