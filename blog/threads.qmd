Threads, from Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, is the fastest growing social
network ever with [tens of millions of active users](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/threads-users). 
It's also about to support the ActivityPub protocol underlying the open Social Web - making it possible
for folks on Mastodon servers like sciences.social to follow people on Threads and vice-versa. 

Some folks have argued that responsible online communities should preemptively block Threads since Meta has
demonstrated [lots](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUSKCN1GO2PN/)

[behavior](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/meta-failure-contributed-to-abuses-against-tigray-ethiopia/).

It's not an easy call, but the moderators and I decided a few months ago that we would take a wait
and see approach to Threads. We'll treat it like other large sites, blocking
accounts that violate our rules and interact with our users. If we see too much bad behavior
by Threads or its users we'll block the whole site. This decision is similar to
the one taken by [datascience.social](https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/)
and [mastodon.social](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/).

Note that you can block Threads for your personal account if you want. There are
some instructions at the end of this post.
And if you would like to migrate your Mastodon account to an instance that pre-emptively
blocks Threads, that's totally understandable too.

### The argument against federating with Threads

There are several arguments against federating with threads.

1. People worry about "Embrace, Extend and Extinguish". If Threads becomes
the dominant player in the fediverse, they will be able to dictate standards and then 
that make it difficult for others

2. People don't want their posts to be indexed and monetized by Threads, nor do they
want their data to become part of Threads advertising and AI schemes.

3. Meta has been a bad actor in the world. We shouldn't doing anything that helps
them succeed. 

The most compelling argument against federating that I've seen comes from 
[Erin Kissane](https://erinkissane.com/untangling-threads). It's worth a read. 

### The argument for federating

There are two main arguments for federating with Threads. 

1. If we want the open Social Web to become a default communications mechanism and truly
displace X and other proprietary platforms, we are going to need many millions of
non-techy people to join. That likely means big coroporations are going to need to support them. 
Very few of us would sign up for a mail server that won't send to gmail addresses, 
and arguably Threads is to the fediverse as Gmail is to email.

2. There's a lot of people on Threads who we might want to interact with. If you're
like me you probably don't care what the Kardashians are doing, but there are 
millions of other people on threads, and I
know that there are some that are looking to connect with scientific content.

People like Mastodon Founder [Eugene Rochko](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/) and
Fediverse evangelist [Tim Chambers](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/) have been making the argument for treating 
Threads like any other new server.

### What you can do as an individual

As a member of a community that is going to federate with Threads, you still can control
whether you see any posts from Threads and whether Threads receives posts directly
from you. These steps are illustrated at the bottom of [this post from infosec.exchange](https://blog.infosec.exchange/2023/12/27/threads-and-infosec-exchange/). 

1. Search for threads.net in the web app
2. Click on any account from there
3. Use the ... dropdown and choose "Block domain threads.net"

One thing that should be clear is that nothing you put out on the public internet is safe from being
indexed and searched by Meta or anyone else. There are rules and conventions 
that the big search engines say they follow, 
but as long as it is technically possible for people to read your posts 
without a login, there's no foolproof protection.
