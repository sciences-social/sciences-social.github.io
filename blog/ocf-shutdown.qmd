We got a mail from The Open Collective Foundation the other day saying [they are shutting down](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odj1zfwqZgIyGOeBhv5QZxYHn422VOMdo32i3T3CPps/edit). 

Sciences.social relies on donations to keep running. Since
we are a not for profit (and unpaid) team, we signed up for "fiscal sponsorship" from
the Open Collective Foundation, which took a small cut of donations, allowed
donations to be tax deductible and supplied online services.

Most importantly, they had tools supplied by the *for-profit* Open Collective company
that allowed us to take donations and show all expenses
[on our home page](https://opencollective.com/sciences-social). 

We won't lose any money in the transition. At the moment our account shows a balance of \$904.09 and we
have pending expenses of $642.55 so we will be able to spend the remaining \$262
down before they shut down completely in September.

If you have recurring donations running
through OCF, March 15th should be the last date you are charged, but you can
turn them off manually.

- Go to [our page](https://opencollective.com/sciences-social)
- Log in
- Click your initials and choose "Profile"
- Find the recurring contribution and click "Edit"
- Click cancel

Whether you do or do not currently give monthly, I now encourage you to 
do so via our sciences.social Ko-Fi account. Our hosting
expenses are \$200 per month[^1] and we took in < \$150 over the last month
including my \$50/month donation. That's not gonna get it done long term.

[^1]: I had it down to \$149/month but we reached to 99.97% database capacity today.
